# Task 2 Overview 

- The marketing team at Sprocket Central Pty Ltd provided a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes, but these customers did not have prior transaction history with the organization.

- The marketing team believed that analyzing the data would reveal useful customer insights to optimize resource allocation for targeted marketing and improve performance by focusing on high-value customers.

- The task assigned was to recommend which of the 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organization, using the existing three datasets (Customer Demographic, Customer Address, and Transactions) as a labeled dataset.

- A PowerPoint presentation was required to outline the approach for the three phases of the project: Data Exploration, Model Development, and Interpretation.

- The detailed approach for completing the analysis, including activities such as understanding data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modeling, results interpretation, and reporting, needed to be presented to the client for sign-off.
